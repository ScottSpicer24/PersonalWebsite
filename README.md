# PersonalWebsite
Website I built hosted by Gitlab pages. it can be found at ***scottspicer.com*** or at ***scottspicer.gitlab.io/website***.<br>
*home.html* was the original website I built but I felt it wasn't good enought so I made another.<br>
*home2.html* is the same as the current itteration I have but it wasn't optimized for mobile.<br>
*index.html* holds the html code for the current itteration of the site. The other files in this repository are 
pictures used in the website.
